# Sinc – Social Media App (Unfinished Project)

Sinc is a social media app I started building using SwiftUI. The goal was to create a simple platform where users could create posts, view a feed, and manage basic profile information.

This project is currently **unfinished**, and development was paused after the input validation logic was separated into a reusable framework (`Sinc2`), which is still maintained.

## 🔍 Goals of the Project

- Build a basic social feed in SwiftUI
- Allow user-generated content (posts, usernames, profile info)
- Implement input validation and error handling
- Explore backend integration (planned but not implemented)

## ✅ What Was Completed

- Initial UI design for feed and post creation
- Input validation framework (now extracted to its own repo)
- Navigation structure and view models

## 🛑 Why It’s Unfinished

The project was paused due to time constraints and a shift in focus toward more reusable components and smaller, focused projects. However, the work done on Sinc led to the creation of the `Sinc-Flutter` which will be the completed version
